# Astro-Gleym

This project is a learning experiment where I explored the integration of Nginx, CI/CD pipelines, and Docker alongside building an application with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## Features

- **Astro Framework**: Leveraged Astro for building a fast, content-focused web application.
- **Nginx**: Configured Nginx for serving static files and acting as a reverse proxy.
- **CI/CD**: Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
- **Docker**: Containerized the application for consistent development and production environments.
